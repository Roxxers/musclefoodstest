# Vending Machine Logic

This project is a library to provide the logic for a vending machine. There is no runnable code on its own as it is designed to be implemented within a physical machine. But there are unit tests to ensure the library runs as intended in all scenarios.

## Installing

To install, clone the repo, and run `npm i` in the directory created.

## Running tests

To run the unit tests, use the command `npm run tests`.
